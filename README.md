# Blossom Tech

Our website was created to address the significant lack of diversity in tech. We believe that coding should be accessible to everyone, regardless of age, gender, background, or interests. Our mission is to empower individuals from all demographics to learn how to code, providing tailored lesson plans that align with each person's unique passions and goals. By embracing diversity, we aim to break down barriers and inspire a new generation of tech creators who reflect the world we live in.

## Code Structure

There are two HTML files and one CSS file in the directory. The main HTML page is the index.html page and the other is called sample_lesson.html. The one CSS file handles styling for both of these HTML pages. The last file in the directory is this file the README. 


## Running the Website Locally

Our website is hosted on github pages so you simply need to go to the URL: 
"https://gavrielatm3.github.io/COMP333_Website/" 

If you clone the repo locally you can view the HTML files in your browser. 


## Notes 

We did not include the issue numbers in the branch commits. There are issues which correspond to the branches, but we did not specify which issue when we pushed a branch.
